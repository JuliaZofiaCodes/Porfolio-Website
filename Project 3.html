                <p>
                    Less Waste
                    <br><br>
                    In the natural world, there is no such thing as ‚Äúwaste‚Äù - everything is recycled down to every atom.
                    But here comes the human. Rapid growth in the 19th century started creating today's modern,
                    demanding consumers, Us.
                    <br><br>
                    A statistical European produces about 500 kg of municipal waste, and - according to Eurostat data
                    from 2020 - this value varies depending on the country from about 280 kg (in Romania) to even 844 kg
                    per inhabitant (in Denmark).
                    <br><br>
                    Recycling itself will not do the job. It's a last call to radically slash the waste output and take
                    into the action 5 zero waste rules:
                    - refuse what you don't need
                    - reduce what you do use
                    - reuse (or repair) whatever you can
                    - recycle what you can't refuse or reduce
                    - rot what's left over.
                    <br><br>
                    How to make everyone adopt the habits everyday and also keep them during a crisis like pandemia?
                    It's time for you, the brightest minds in Europe, to come up with the most complex solutions, during
                    HackYeah 2022 in Krak√≥w!
                    Let's create a zero waste, meaningful future for all, before it's too late!

                <h4>UX Research</h4>

                During the research phase I familiarize myselve with the activity of Facebook groups related to the
                topic of zero/less waste. I concluded that the community mainly seeks knowledge about reusing things
                like unrepairable items, containers, trash, etc. We decided to give them a more structured plarform that
                would atract people interested in sustainibility.

                <h5>Benefits of the app over current solutions: facebook groups</h5>

                Facebook groups are known to be not structured too well and not the best for searching.

                With our product, we give users a better experience by getting more knowledgeable with upcycling
                possibilities.

                The community aspect of the app is encouraging and supportive, similar to facebook groups,

                <h4>Product features</h4>

                The main features of our web app allow users browse for ideas how to reuse an item (or items). As search
                results the app display easy, quick tips how to reuse items that does not require any modification of
                the items and DIY tutorials featuring those items.

                The algorithm of the apps filters results to display ideas that do not require using additional stuff
                that the user may not have. The idea of less waste is to limit consuption, so we don't want to encourage
                additional buying.

                The app is designed to be community-driven. Users can submit their responses on how to reuse a
                particular item, comment on the topic, rate the responses. The algorith than use their responses to give
                the best ideas for future search results

                <h4>Difficulties and complications we encountered, and what we learned along the way</h4>

                We spent quite a while on idealizing phase of the project. We would definetely benefit from using tools
                for evaluating and filtering ideas in a more agile way

                In the future we would definetely need additional front-end developer. The workload was quite a lot
                for two front-end members

                <h4>Ideas for future</h4>

                Q/A - what can I do with ... ?
                All this ideas can be overwhelming - some roadmap to get started?
