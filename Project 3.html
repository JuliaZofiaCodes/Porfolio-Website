                <p>
                    Less Waste
                    <br><br>
                    In the natural world, there is no such thing as ‚Äúwaste‚Äù - everything is recycled down to every atom.
                    But here comes the human. Rapid growth in the 19th century started creating today's modern,
                    demanding consumers, Us.
                    <br><br>
                    A statistical European produces about 500 kg of municipal waste, and - according to Eurostat data
                    from 2020 - this value varies depending on the country from about 280 kg (in Romania) to even 844 kg
                    per inhabitant (in Denmark).
                    <br><br>
                    Recycling itself will not do the job. It is a last call to radically slash the waste output and take
                    into the action 5 zero waste rules:
                    - refuse what you don't need
                    - reduce what you do use
                    - reuse (or repair) whatever you can
                    - recycle what you can't refuse or reduce
                    - rot what's left over.
                    <br><br>
                    How to make everyone adopt the habits everyday and also keep them during a crisis like a pandemic?
                    It's time for you, the brightest minds in Europe, to come up with the most complex solutions, during
                    HackYeah 2022 in Krak√≥w!
                    Let's create a zero waste, meaningful future for all, before it's too late!

                <h4>My contribution</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Desk Research</li>
                    <li>UX Design</li>
                    <li>Prototyping</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Desk Research</h4>

                <p>During the research phase I familiarized myself with the activity of Facebook groups related to the
                    topic of zero/less waste. I concluded that the community mainly seeks knowledge about reusing
                    things, such as unrepairable items, containers, or trash.
                    As a team we decided to give them a more structured plarform
                    that
                    would atract people interested in sustainibility.</p>

                <h5>Benefits of the App Over Current Solutions: Facebook Groups</h5>

                <p>Facebook groups are known to lack structure and to make searching difficult.

                    With our product, we give users a better experience by familiarizing them with upcycling
                    possibilities.

                    The community aspect of the app is encouraging and supportive, similar to Facebook groups, but much
                    better organized.</p>

                <h4>Product Features</h4>

                <p>The main features of our web app allow users browse for ideas how to reuse one or more item.
                    Our app displays easy and quick tips for how to reuse items, as well as DIY tutorials featuring them
                    as search results.
                    Importantly, the proposed tips do not require any mofifications of the items.

                    The algorithm that we implemented in our app filters the results in order to display ideas that do
                    not require using
                    tools
                    that the user may not have. The intuition behind it follows the spirit of less waste, which is to
                    limit consuption.
                    This is why we aim to limit the incentives for
                    making additional purchases.

                    The app is designed to be community-driven. Hence, users can submit their responses on how to reuse
                    a
                    particular item, comment on the topic, or rate the responses of other users. Following such
                    information,
                    our algorithm provides
                    optimized
                    ideas for future search results</p>

                <h4>Difficulties and Complications we Encountered and what we Learned Along the Way</h4>

                <p>We spent quite a while on the idealizing phase of the project. We would definetely benefit from using
                    tools
                    for evaluating and filtering ideas in a more agile way.

                    In the future we would definetely need an additional front-end developer, as the workload was quite
                    a lot
                    for two front-end members.</p>
