                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    After the 4-week UX/UI & Accessibility Design course organized by Code First Girls, students had a
                    chance to face a challenge hosted by Brandwatch.

                    There were two objectives of the challenge:
                <ul>
                    <li> to perform an accessibility audit on a e-commerce website selected by a team</li>
                    <li> using the knowledge gained after audit: to design (and build) a new website with aspects to
                        enhance accessibility</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>My contribution</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>performing a technical audit to find accessibility shortcomings</li>
                    <li>testing of the prototype</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Audit</h4>

                We decided to base our project on a well-known store's e-commerce website: Flying Tiger Copenhagen,
                which is a one-stop shop, where users can get everything from: homeware, electronics, school and office
                supplies, toys and much more.<br>

                These are issues we identified:

                <h5>Over-Crowding</h5>

                The website has an unnecessarily overcrowded header with five different icons. Example the wishlist
                icon (heart) becomes an overpopulated icon. The enquiry mailbox is already available in the footer
                and navigation hence no need for additional option to be present.

                <h5>Option Overload</h5>

                Due to overcrowding and too many options, it is highly likely that in user journeys “overchoice”
                occurs. The option overload causing the consumer to become overwhelmed thinking about the benefits
                and risk of their potential choices.

                <h5>No Speech-To-Text Feature</h5>

                The website is accessible from a language perspective but it needs to be improved to be made more
                accessible for neurodivergent consumers. The search bar has no speech-to-text feature which is
                essential for dyslexic consumers to carry out their search.

                <h5>Keyboard Accessibility</h5>

                There is also no keyboard accessibility for people who have tremors and difficulty controlling
                mousepad.

                <h5>Source Code</h5>

                Issues with source code that makes a website hard to be captured by screen readers.

                <ul>
                    <li>List items "li" are not contained within "ul" or "ol" parent</li>
                    elements.
                    <li>ARIA input fields do not have accessible names</li>
                    <li>Links do not have a discernible name</li>
                    <li>Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order</li>
                    <li>Many of the images lack alt texts</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
