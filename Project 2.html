                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    After the 4-week UX/UI & Accessibility Design course organized by Code First Girls, students had a
                    chance to face a challenge hosted by Brandwatch.

                    There were two objectives of the challenge:
                <ul>
                    <li>To perform an accessibility audit on a e-commerce website selected by a team</li>
                    <li>Using the knowledge gained after audit: to design (and build) a new website with aspects to
                        enhance accessibility</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Our Contribution</h4>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>performing a technical audit to find accessibility shortcomings</li>
                    <li>testing of the prototype</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Audit</h4>

                We decided to base our project on an e-commerce website of a well-known brand, Flying Tiger Copenhagen.
                In this one-stop shop users can get everything from homeware, electronics, school and office
                supplies, toys and much more.<br>

                These are the issues we identified:

                <h5>Over-Crowding</h5>

                The website has an unnecessarily overcrowded header with five different icons. For instance, the wishlist
                icon (heart) becomes an overpopulated icon. The inquiry mailbox is already available in the footer
                and navigation hence no need for additional option to be present.

                <h5>Option Overload</h5>

                Due to overcrowding and too many options, it is highly likely that in user journeys ‚Äúoverchoice‚Äù
                occurs. Further, the option overload might overwhelm the consumer with thinking about the benefits
                and risk of their potential choices.

                <h5>No Speech-To-Text Feature</h5>

                The website is accessible from a language perspective but it needs to be improved to be made more
                accessible for neurodivergent consumers. The search bar has no speech-to-text feature, which is
                essential for dyslexic consumers to carry out their search.

                <h5>Keyboard Accessibility</h5>

                There is also no keyboard accessibility for people who have tremors and difficulty controlling
                mousepad.

                <h5>Source Code</h5>

                Issues with source code that makes a website hard to be captured by screen readers:

                <ul>
                    <li>List items "li" are not contained within "ul" or "ol" parent</li>
                    elements
                    <li>ARIA input fields do not have accessible names</li>
                    <li>Links do not have a discernible name</li>
                    <li>Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order</li>
                    <li>Many of the images lack alt texts</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Improvement <br> Our Website Project: The Fuschia Marketplace</h4>
                <br>
                Our website is majorly designed for improving accessibility of websites on mobile because most of the
                browser based websites fail to take in consideration the use of compact mobile screens. Following are the
                features of our website project:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adaptive mobile design which distributes the long navigation list into two components:
                        categories on
                        homepage and bottom navigation bar for easy access.</li>

                    <li>Easy and common login flow for easy adaption. This is added to reduce scrolling and multiple
                        content
                        boxes on a single page that takes up bandwidth and affect user journeys.</li>

                    <li>Speech-to-text for searching and text-to-speech for products are added for people with
                        disabilities
                        who might not have adaptable accessibility setting on their devices.</li>

                    <li>In case the image does not load the image alt text shows up. Alt
                        text will be encoded with every image so that screen readers can
                        easily pick them.</li>

                    <li>Better contract for all special offers and add to wishlist button in
                        product description for a smooth user experience.</li>

                    <li>We retained the langauge switch option on our website as this
                        make for an inclusive website but rather the dropdowns being a
                        long list of items we have added them as overlays.</li>

                    <li>Keyboard accessibility is included in the homepage where tab,
                        down key, and enter can take you through the website.
                        We made it easy to add to cart and support local business.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                From all we learned after Flying Tiger website audit and UI/UX sprint, we made sure to improve on the
                shortcomings, include what was best, and add in our ideas through multiple brainstorming session to come
                up with 'Fuschia' store website.
