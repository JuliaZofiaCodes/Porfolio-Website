                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    After the 4-week UX/UI & Accessibility Design course organized by Code First Girls, students had a
                    chance to face a challenge hosted by Brandwatch.

                    There were two objectives of the challenge: <br>
                    <br>• To perform an accessibility audit on a e-commerce website selected by a team
                    <br>• Using the knowledge gained after audit: to design (and build) a new website with aspects to
                    enhance accessibility
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>My contribution</h3>
                <p>
                    • performing a technical audit (code) to find accessibility shortcomings <br>
                    • testing of the prototype <br>

                    <h3>Audit</h3>
                    Issues we identified:<br>

                    <br>• Over-Crowding<br>

                    <br>The website has an unnecessarily overcrowded header with five different icons. Example the wishlist
                    icon (heart) becomes an overpopulated icon. The enquiry mailbox is already available in the footer
                    and navigation hence no need for additional option to be present.<br>

                    <br>• Option Overload<br>

                    <br>Due to overcrowding and too many options, it is highly likely that in user journeys “over choice”
                    occurs. The option overload causing the consumer to become overwhelmed thinking about the benefits
                    and risk of their potential choices.<br>

                    <br>• The website is accessible from a language perspective but it needs to be improved to be made more
                    accessible for neurodivergent consumers. The search bar has no speech-to-text feature which is
                    essential for dyslexic consumers to carry out their search.<br>

                    <br>• There is also no keyboard accessibility for people who have tremors and difficulty controlling
                    mousepad.<br>

                    <br>Issues with source code that makes a website hard to be captured by screen readers.<br>

                    <br>• List items "li" are not contained within "ul" or "ol" parent
                                elements.
                    <br>• ARIA input fields do not have accessible names.
                    <br> • Links do not have a discernible name.
                    <br>• Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order.
                    <br> • Many of the images lack alt texts and have contrast issues.
